Q1: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A1: Output shows "Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/zpiao/version-control/reflections/.git/". 
Need to do it because it is necessary so that git can keep my histories.
Q2: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A2: It is only created if I add files for being committed later. It is like a temporary directory then I can commit everything that I have added later.
Q3: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
A3: Use "git diff" to see the difference between the working directory and the staging area.
Use "git diff --staged" to see the difference between the staging area and the most recent commit if under master.
Q4: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
A4: Add some features that I'm not so sure with or for other reasons. It is non-linear and I can switch to the branches while not changing the master, which is the most likely part that I will publish.
Q5: How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
A5: Sometimes when I create a new branch, other people will create as well. I can know what commit their branch is based on and merge later by using the diagrams. It helps me to manage the branches very well.
Q6: What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
A6: Create a new commit that uses the latest commits of the branches indicated in the instruction as parents.
We still want to trace the changes within each branch.
